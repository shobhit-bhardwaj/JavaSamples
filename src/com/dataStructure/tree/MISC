1.
Total Number of Possible Binary Search Trees with n Keys :-
(2n)! / (n+1)! * n!

For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... values of Catalan numbers are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ... So are numbers of Binary Search Trees.


2. Shortest path between 2 nodes in BST is the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of two nodes.
