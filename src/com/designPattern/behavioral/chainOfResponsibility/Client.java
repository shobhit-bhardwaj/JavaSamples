/*
 * The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking receiving objects together.
 * It allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request, independently of any other object along the chain.
 * 
 * Once the request is handled, it completes itâ€™s journey through the chain. Extra handlers can be added or removed from chain without modifying the logic inside any of concrete handler.
